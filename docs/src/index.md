## Features

Qaintensor.jl is an extension to the  digital quantum circuit toolbox and simulator Qaintessent.jl. This library allows the conversion of Circuit/CircuitGateChain objects created in Qaintessent.jl into TensorNetwork objects. (See [Tensors](@ref) for details regarding conversion and the creation of general TensorNetworks). Qaintensor.jl currently supports MPS and MPO states, see [MPS Representation](@ref) and [MPO Representation](@ref).
