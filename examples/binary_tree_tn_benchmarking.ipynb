    "The paradigmatic tensor network for one dimension is the *Matrix Product State* (MPS), which consists on a chain of tensors, each of them connected with their previous and next neighbouring tensors. MPS states might seem the most natural representation for the input state of a quantum circuit, since we usually represent qubits in a line. Nevertheless, note that the distance between two qubits in a MPS is  $O(N)$ in the worst case, where $N$ is the number of particles in the chain. This means that, when applying an arbitrary gate to two qubits, we might increase the bond dimension -- and therefore the entanglement -- of the whole chain, whereas we actually only want to affect a small region. An increase in the bond dimension results in an increase of the complexity of the contraction of the final state, which can then become highly inefficient. "
